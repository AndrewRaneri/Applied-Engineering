# ChEn-3170 Computational Methods in Chemical Engineering [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dpploy/chen-3170/master)

    University of Massachusetts Lowell, Fall 2018  
    Prof. Valmor F. de Almeida (valmor_dealmeida@uml.edu)

This course uses Jupyter Notebooks in Python programming language. The content can be accessed in
two ways:
+ Static HTML version of the notebooks will be displayed on the current browser if a 
notebook file listed in the code repository is clicked on.
+ Click on the `launch/binder` badge above to launch a Jupyter Notebook server for the
course notebooks. There will be a delay for the Binder cloud server to build a 
Python (Anaconda) programming environment for you. However once it is done, it will 
start a Jupyter Notebook server on your web browser with all notebooks listed. Upon 
clicking on individual notebook files, you will access the live course notebooks.
