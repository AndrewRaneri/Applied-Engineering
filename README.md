Static HTML versions of the notebooks will be displayed on the current browser if a notebook 
file listed in the code repository is clicked on.

Click on the `launch/binder` badge above to launch a Jupyter Notebook server for the
course notebooks. There will be a delay for the Binder cloud server to build a Anaconda
environment for you. However once it is done, it will start a Jupyter Notebook
server on your web browser with all notebooks listed. Upon clicking on individual notebook
files, you will access the live course notebooks.
