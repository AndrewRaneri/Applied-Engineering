    "The electronic laboratory notebook will be collected and graded for technical content, style and grammar, and for overall professional appearance. The graded laboratory work represents a significant part of the evaluation process for this course since it is expected that a large part of the learning of the course material will be associated with the student’s effort on the laboratory work assignments. All assignments are individual. Make up of late laboratory work assignments and exams will be resolved on a case-by-case basis if there is enough evidence of a special circumstance.\n",
